   <h4>How long should you fast before a blood test?</h4>
   <div class="alert alert-info w-50 mt-4">
     <p class="font-weight-bolder">Note</p>
     <p>Take your test as early as possible. The hours you spend sleeping are considered part of the fasting period, as long as you don’t break your fast with coffee or food once you’re awake.</p>

   <h4>Drinking water before a blood test?</h4>
   <div class="alert alert-info w-50 mt-4">
     <p class="font-weight-bolder">Note</p>
     <p>Water hydrates your body and makes your veins more visible.<br>Stay hydrated in the two days before your test. Also try drinking several glasses of water right before the blood draw to make it easier.</p>

    <h4>What about fasting for pregnant woman?</h4>
   <div class="alert alert-info w-50 mt-4">
     <p class="font-weight-bolder">Note</p>
     <p>If you don’t fast before a test that requires it, the results may not be accurate. If you forget and eat or drink something, call your provider and ask if the test can still be done. Some tests can be analyzed with a notation that it isn’t fasting and results may vary. The main thing is to be honest. If you had a snack, a cup of coffee, or even a full breakfast, tell the technician when you have your blood drawn. They should make a note so that the results are reviewed with the food intake as a variable. And if fasting is an absolute must for meaningful results, they should stop and reschedule your blood draw.<p>
